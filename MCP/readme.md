Model Context Protocols(MCP)

What is the importance of MCP ?

LLM models are pretrained on huge dataset for general knowledge but they lack access to the real-time information or relevent information and tools. It hinders the potential of AI systems to provide relevent, accurate and helpfull responses.

MCP enables LLM models to connect with external data sources, tools and enviroments, allow smooth transfer of information between LLM models and digital world. This interoperability is importent for growth and adaptation of the true usefullness of AI systems.

Integration problems 

connecting M llms with N sources 

Without MCP i.e Mx N problem

reduce integration complexity and maintainance burdan
