Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms

Ensemble Methods 

1. Idea - It don't rely on a single model; instead, combine the predictions from several models to make a final, better decision.
2. Analogous - To asking a group of experts for their opinion instead of just one. Even if some experts are wrong, the "wisdom of the crowd" often leads to a more accurate and robust answer.
3. It helps to improve generalizatin and reduce overfitting such that model perform well on unseen data.

Statistical - **Ensemble methods** combine the predictions of several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability/robustness over a single estimator.[1]
