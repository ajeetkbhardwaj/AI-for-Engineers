# ðŸ“„ A Guide to Building a Custom MCP Tool Server with LangChain and fastmcp

---

### **1. Introduction**

In the rapidly evolving field of AI agents, granting Large Language Models (LLMs) access to external tools is paramount. This allows them to interact with the real world, access proprietary data, and perform complex computations. However, managing these tools in production can be complex, especially when they are written in different languages or require secure, isolated execution.

The **Model-Communication-Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard designed to solve this problem. It provides a standardized interface for AI tools, allowing an AI agent (the "client") to discover and execute tools hosted on a dedicated "server." This **decouples** the agent's logic from the tool's implementation, leading to more robust and scalable systems.

This report documents the process of building a complete MCP-based system. We will:

1. Create a custom `SimpleCalculator` toolset in Python.
2. Expose these tools via a lightweight MCP server using `fastmcp`.
3. Build an intelligent agent using `LangChain` and `LangGraph` that connects to the server and uses the tools to solve user queries.
4. Analyze critical challenges encountered, particularly regarding LLM reliability, and present the final, working solution.

---

### **2. Project Architecture**

Our final system consists of two independent components that communicate over HTTP:

1. **The MCP Server (`server.py`):** A standalone Python process running `fastmcp`. Its sole responsibility is to define the `SimpleCalculator` tools and listen for execution requests.
2. **The Agentic Client (`client.py`):** A LangGraph-powered agent. It connects to the server at runtime, dynamically fetches the available tools, and uses a powerful LLM (`gpt-4o-mini`) to reason about when and how to use them to answer user questions.

---

### **3. How to Run This Project**

#### **Step 1: Project Setup**

Project structure:

```
/CustomMCPServer/
|-- .env
|-- server.py
|-- client.py
|-- requirements.txt
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure OpenAI API key in `.env`:

```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

#### **Step 2: Start the MCP Tool Server**

```bash
python server.py
```

Expected:
`INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

#### **Step 3: Run the Agentic Client**

```bash
python client.py
```

---

### **4. Key Lessons Learned**

* **LLM Reliability Matters:** Early attempts with weaker models failed because they didnâ€™t properly generate tool calls. Switching to **`gpt-4o-mini`** solved this.
* **MCPâ€™s Value:** We never touched `server.py` after defining tools â€” all debugging was isolated to the LLM side.


---

### **5. Code Implementation**

#### `server.py`
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

import logging
import inspect
 


# setup mcp server intialization
mcp = FastMCP(name="SimpleCalculator")

class SimpleCalculator:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    # let's build a simple calculator tools
    @mcp.tool(name="add", description="Adds two integers")
    def add(a:int, b: int) -> int:
       return a + b
    @mcp.tool( name="subtract", description="Subtracts second integer from first")
    def subtract(a:int, b: int) -> int:
       return a - b
    @mcp.tool( name="multiply", description="Multiplies two integers")
    def multiply(a:int, b: int) -> int:
       return a * b
    @mcp.tool( name="divide", description="Divides first float by second float")
    def divide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
        if b == 0:
           raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return a / b
    @mcp.tool( name="power", description="Raises first integer to the power of second integer")
    def power(a: int, b: int) -> int:
       return a ** b 
    @mcp.tool( name="square_root", description="Calculates the square root of a float")
    def square_root(a: float) -> float:
        if a < 0:
          raise ValueError("Cannot compute square root of negative number")
        return a ** 0.5
    @mcp.tool( name="factorial", description="Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer")
    def factorial(n: int) -> int:
       if n < 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot compute factorial of negative number")
       if n == 0 or n == 1:
          return 1
       result = 1
       for i in range(2, n+1):
              result *= i
       return result
    

tools = SimpleCalculator()
# Register the tools with the MCP server
for _,methods in inspect.getmembers(tools, predicate=callable):
    if getattr(methods, 'is_tool', False):
        mcp.add_tool(methods)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start the MCP server
    #mcp.run(transport="stdio")
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    logging.info("Starting SimpleCalculator MCP server...")
    mcp.run(transport="streamable-http")
    
```

### **6. Example Output**

The agent successfully fetched **7 tools** and processed queries step by step, correctly reasoning(depends upon the llm we use) through calculations such as factorial and nested arithmetic expressions.

---
```txt
Fetching tools from MCP server...
Successfully fetched 7 tools.

--- Running Example 1 ---
Query: what's 45 + 67?
Agent:  To calculate the sum of two integers, you can use the `add` function with the provided code:

```txt
const result = add({a: 45, b: 67});
console.log(result); // Output: 112
```txt

In addition, here's a table showing the other basic arithmetic operations supported by the provided code:

- Subtraction: `subtract({a: 45, b: 67})` - Output: `-22`
- Multiplication: `multiply({a: 45, b: 67})` - Output: `2945`
- Division: `divide({a: 45, b: 67})` - Output: `0.677465664327441` (Note: Division result may be approximate due to floating-point precision)

For more complex calculations such as power, square root, or factorial, follow the same pattern using the appropriate function names provided.
------------------------

--- Running Example 2 ---
Query: compute 123 - 58
Agent:  [control_308] { "name": "subtract", "arguments": {"a": 123, "b": 58}} DRAFT
------------------------

--- Running Example 3 ---
Query: multiply 42 by 19
Agent:   
Agent: 798
Agent:  The result is 798.
------------------------

--- Running Example 4 ---
Query: divide 144 by 12
Agent:  
Agent: 12.0
Agent:  The result of dividing 144 by 12 is 12.0.
------------------------

--- Running Example 5 ---
Query: what is 5 factorial?
Agent:  To calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, you can use the `factorial` function like this:

~~~
result = factorial({"n": 5})
print(result)
~~~

The output will be:

~~~
120
~~~

This is because the factorial of 5 (denoted as 5!) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 5:

~~~
5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
~~~
------------------------

--- Running Example 6 ---
Query: what is (8 + 2) * (5 - 3)?
Agent:  [TOOL_CALLS] To calculate this expression, we need to use the addition, subtraction, and multiplication functions from the list above.

1. First, calculate `8 + 2`, which gives `10`.
2. Then, calculate `5 - 3`, which gives `2`.
3. Finally, multiply the results from the previous steps, `10 * 2`, which gives `20`.

So the result of `(8 + 2) * (5 - 3)` is `20`.
------------------------

```
